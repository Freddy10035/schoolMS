# School Management System

This project is a School Management System (SMS) designed to help school administrators manage their school's data. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing student information, staff information, and other school-related data. 

The system is written in PHP and uses a MySQL database for data storage. It also includes a web-based user interface for accessing the system from any web browser. 

The system provides features such as: 
* Student registration and enrollment 
* Staff management 
* Course management 
* Gradebook management 
* Scheduling and calendar management 
* Report generation 

 The system also includes an API that can be used to integrate with other systems such as student information systems or financial systems. This allows the school to have a single source of truth for all of its data. 

 The system is designed to be secure, reliable, and easy to use. It has been tested extensively and is ready for deployment in any school environment.
